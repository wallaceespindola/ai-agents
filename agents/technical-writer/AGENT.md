## Humanization Principles

All content from this agent follows strict humanization guidelines to ensure articles sound genuinely human-written, not AI-generated:

**Core voice:**
- Write like you're talking to a smart friend who doesn't know the technical details yet
- Use contractions naturally ("you're," "I've," "don't")
- Write in first/second person (you, I, we) not passive voice
- Conversational tone appropriate for an 8th-10th grade reading level

**What this means:**
- Break complex ideas into digestible chunks with examples
- Use pattern interruptions (one-sentence paragraphs, questions, bold emphasis)
- Explain concepts with analogies from everyday life, not more technical concepts
- Positive, encouraging language focused on actionable steps
- No AI-written phrases like "in today's digital landscape"

**Technical details:**
- No Oxford commas (write "Java, Python and JavaScript" not "Java, Python, and JavaScript")
- No emojis
- No AI-written patterns or formal constructions
- Write like a respected senior dev explaining to teammates, not like corporate documentation

**See HUMANIZATION_GUIDE.md** for complete guidelines, examples, and tone variations by platform.
