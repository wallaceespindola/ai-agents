# Medium Optimization Guide

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- Formatting long-form technical articles for Medium
- Optimizing for Medium's curation algorithm and recommendations
- Improving readability and engagement metrics
- Setting up publications and newsletter integrations
- Creating story structure that keeps readers engaged
- Choosing appropriate tags and categories

## Medium Article Specifications

### Length & Structure
- **Optimal length**: 2,000-7,000 words (Medium favors depth)
- **Reading time**: 6-20 minutes (displayed by Medium)
- **Headline**: 60-80 characters, interesting and specific
- **Subtitle**: 125-150 characters, adds context
- **Sections**: 5-8 well-defined sections
- **Paragraphs**: 2-4 sentences (readability)

### Headline & Subtitle Strategy

#### Headlines
✅ **Good headlines:**
- "Building a Production-Ready REST API with Spring Boot: Complete Guide"
- "Understanding JavaScript Closures Through Real-World Examples"
- "Why Your Python Data Pipeline Is Probably Slow (And How to Fix It)"

❌ **Avoid:**
- Generic: "Introduction to React"
- Unclear: "Advanced Development Stuff"
- Too long: "The Comprehensive Ultimate Guide..."

**Headline rules:**
- Must contain searchable keywords
- 60-80 characters for optimal display
- Promise value or transformation
- Avoid clickbait (Medium demonetizes it)

#### Subtitles
- Add context and search terms: "A step-by-step guide to building secure, scalable APIs"
- Show who it's for: "What senior developers know that juniors don't"
- Include benefit: "How to reduce load times by 60%"

### Formatting for Readability

#### Visual Hierarchy
- **Heading 1 (H1)**: Only for major sections (3-5 per article)
- **Heading 2 (H2)**: Subsections for scanability
- **Heading 3 (H3)**: Sub-subsections, use sparingly
- **Line breaks**: Empty line between paragraphs
- **Emphasis**: Bold for important terms, italic for asides

#### Code Formatting
- **Inline code**: `` `function_name()` ``
- **Code blocks**: Full multi-line examples with syntax highlighting
- **Code length**: Keep examples 15-30 lines max
- **Explanations**: Explain code before and after blocks
- **Language tags**: Specify language for syntax highlighting

**Good code block formatting:**
```java
// Brief explanation of what this does
public class Example {
    private String value;

    public Example(String value) {
        this.value = value;  // Why we set this
    }

    public void process() {
        // Key operation explained in comment
        System.out.println(value.toUpperCase());
    }
}
```

#### Lists & Bullets
- **Bullet points**: For non-sequential items
- **Numbered lists**: For step-by-step instructions
- **Keep short**: Each bullet 1-2 sentences max

### Images & Media Guidelines

#### Featured Image
- **Size**: 1200x627px (Medium standard)
- **Quality**: High-resolution, professional
- **Content**: Related to article topic
- **Copyright**: Use own images or Unsplash/Pexels

#### In-Article Images
- **Types**: Diagrams, architecture, screenshots, flowcharts
- **Placement**: After introducing concept, before deep dive
- **Captions**: Descriptive text under image
- **Count**: 3-5 images in 3,000+ word article
- **Format**: PNG for diagrams, JPG for photos

**Diagram examples:**
- Architecture diagrams
- Flow charts
- Comparison tables
- Performance graphs
- Sequence diagrams

### Tags & Metadata

#### Tags (5 max, 1-2 words each)
Primary tags for discoverability:
- Language-focused: `java`, `python`, `javascript`, `typescript`
- Framework-focused: `react`, `springboot`, `nodejs`, `fastapi`
- Topic-focused: `webdevelopment`, `architecture`, `performance`
- Practice-focused: `bestpractices`, `testing`, `security`

**Tag strategy:**
- 1-2 popular tags (high volume)
- 2-3 specific tags (lower volume, targeted)
- Avoid too many technical tags

#### Topics/Categories
Select 1-2 most relevant topics:
- `Programming`
- `Technology`
- `Software Engineering`
- `Web Development`
- `Open Source`
- `Data Science`

### SEO Optimization for Medium

#### Keywords
- **Primary keyword**: Should appear in headline
- **Secondary keywords**: 3-5 variations in body
- **Long-tail keywords**: "how to," "best practices," "tutorial"

❌ **Overly academic tone**: Make it accessible
❌ **No images**: Text-only articles get lower engagement
❌ **Vague title**: "My Journey" vs. "How I Reduced Database Queries by 90%"
❌ **No code formatting**: Raw code blocks are hard to read
❌ **Excessive self-promotion**: Write for value, not sales
❌ **Too short**: 500-word posts don't perform on Medium

## Example Medium Article Opening

**Headline:** "Building Resilient REST APIs with Spring Boot: A Production Guide"

**Subtitle:** "Learn how Netflix, Amazon, and other scale-ups handle failures, retries, and timeouts without losing user trust"

**Opening hook:**
"Your API is running fine in development. Users are happy. Then it hits production, and your database gets slow. Your downstream service times out. Your cache goes down. And suddenly, you're getting 500 errors and angry customers.

This is the gap between 'it works' and 'it's production-ready.' And it's exactly where most developers make mistakes.

In this guide, we'll build a real REST API that handles all the chaos production throws at it. You'll learn the patterns that Netflix, Amazon, and other scale-ups use to keep their services up when things go wrong."
