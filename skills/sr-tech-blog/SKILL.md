### Headline Strategy

✅ **Good blog headlines:**
- "The Ultimate Guide to Python Async/Await: From Basics to Production"
- "Why Virtual Threads Are a Game-Changer (And How to Use Them in Java)"
- "Building a High-Performance REST API: A Complete Guide With Benchmarks"
- "Designing Microservices at Scale: What We Learned Migrating From Monolith"
- "React Performance Optimization: 15 Techniques I Use in Production"

❌ **Avoid:**
- Generic: "Introduction to Java"
- Misleading: "This One Weird Trick..."
- Vague: "Some Cool Stuff"
- Overhyped: "Revolutionary New Framework"

**Formula:**
**[Specific Topic] + [Scope/Angle] + [Value Promise]**

### Blog Post Tone & Style

**For technical blogs, aim for:**
- **Authoritative but approachable**: You're the expert, but make it accessible
- **Personal**: Share your experience and perspective
- **Opinionated**: Take stances (thoughtfully and with reasoning)
- **Educational**: Teach, don't just inform
- **Practical**: Every concept should have a real application
- **Honest**: Acknowledge limitations and trade-offs
- **Engaging**: Write like you're talking to a colleague

**Example voice:**
"I spent 6 months getting this wrong before I finally understood why. Here's what the documentation doesn't explain clearly, and the approach that actually works in production."

### Code Examples for Blog Posts

#### Guidelines
- **Complete and runnable**: Readers can copy and run
- **Well-commented**: Explain the important parts
- **Production-concerned**: Include error handling, logging
- **Varied**: Show simple, medium, and complex examples
- **Tested**: You've actually run this code
- **Modern**: Use current language features and frameworks

#### Formatting
```java
// Code example with explanation
// Key concept: explain architectural decision

@SpringBootApplication
public class ProductionExample {
    // Implementation with production concerns
    // (error handling, logging, metrics, monitoring)

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(ProductionExample.class, args);
    }
}
```
