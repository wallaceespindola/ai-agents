## File Conventions

### Agent Files (agents/{name}/AGENT.md)
- Title: Agent name and role
- Sections: Profile, Expertise, Capabilities, Workflow, Quality Standards, Tools & Skills, Collaboration
- Lists associated skills with brief descriptions
- Includes "When to Use" guidance

### Skill Files (skills/{name}/SKILL.md)
- YAML frontmatter: name and description
- Sections: When to Use, Quick Start, How It Works, Configuration, Examples, Best Practices, Integration
- Each skill: 2,000-4,000 words with production-ready examples
- Real code examples with configuration templates
- Best practices and integration guidance

### Documentation
- AGENTS.md: Quick reference of all agents and skills
- AGENTS_GUIDE.md: Comprehensive guide with workflows
- SKILLS_INDEX.md: Complete skills catalog
- SYSTEM_MAP.md: Architecture and relationships
- GETTING_STARTED.md: Setup and onboarding

## Naming Conventions

### Agents
- Format: descriptive name with role (e.g., "Java Developer Agent")
- Directory: kebab-case (e.g., java-developer)

### Skills
- Format: kebab-case with clear purpose (e.g., github-actions-workflows)
- Directory: matches skill name exactly
- File: always SKILL.md

### Content
- Headings: Use consistent markdown hierarchy (# Agent, ## Section)
- Lists: Use bullet points for capabilities, numbered for steps
- Code blocks: Use markdown with language specification
- Links: Relative paths to docs and skills

## Writing Guidelines

### For New Agent Descriptions
1. Start with clear role and expertise areas
2. List capabilities concisely (5-8 items)
3. Include workflow steps (5-8 steps)
4. Define quality standards
5. List associated skills
6. Include collaboration points
7. Reference agent file location

### For New Skill Descriptions
1. Start with "When to Use" scenarios
2. Include Quick Start (usage example)
3. Explain "How It Works" (5-7 subsections)
4. Provide Configuration with templates
5. Include 3-7 production-ready examples
6. Add Best Practices section
7. List Integration with other skills

### Common Patterns
- Use consistent formatting for lists and tables
- Reference other agents/skills with skill name in backticks
- Include real-world examples and code
- Emphasize practical application
- Reference files with `agents/{name}/AGENT.md` format
- Use section dividers (---) for clarity

## Code Examples Standards

- Include complete, runnable examples
- Show both good (✅) and bad (❌) patterns
- Use proper syntax highlighting
- Add comments explaining key parts
- Reference related concepts
- Provide configuration templates

## Testing & Quality

When suggesting code for skills or agents:
- Ensure examples are production-ready
- Include error handling
- Show security best practices
- Provide clear explanations
- Reference documentation links

## Cross-References

When suggesting links between content:
- Use relative paths: `docs/guides/SKILLS_INDEX.md`
- Reference agent files: `agents/java-developer/AGENT.md`
- Reference skills: Use backticks for skill names
- Use section anchors for deep linking

## Skill Integration Patterns

Common skill combinations:
- Code review + testing strategy + performance tuning
- Project planning + risk assessment + status reporting
- Architecture review + system design + scalability analysis
- CI/CD setup + Docker setup + Kubernetes setup
- GitHub Actions + Git workflows + pre-commit hooks

## Platform & Technology Coverage

### Backend
- Java 17+, Spring Boot 3.x, Spring Cloud
- Python 3.10+, FastAPI, async/await
- Quarkus, GraalVM native
- Microservices, distributed systems

### Frontend
- React 18+, Next.js 15+
- TypeScript, component patterns
- Custom hooks, state management
- Testing (Jest, RTL), Storybook

### Infrastructure
- GitHub Actions, Git workflows
- Docker, Kubernetes, Helm
- Terraform, Infrastructure as Code
- Monitoring (Prometheus, Grafana)
- CI/CD (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins)

### Platforms
- GitHub (primary)
- GitLab CI (mentioned)
- Jenkins (mentioned)
- AWS, Azure, GCP

### Testing
- JUnit 5, Mockito, TestContainers (Java)
- pytest, unittest (Python)
- Jest, React Testing Library (JS)
- Cypress, Playwright, Selenium (E2E)

## Key Principles

1. **Comprehensive**: Cover all major aspects of each topic
2. **Practical**: Include real-world examples and configurations
3. **Current**: Use modern versions and best practices
4. **Clear**: Organize with consistent structure
5. **Interconnected**: Link related skills and agents
6. **Actionable**: Provide steps users can implement immediately

## Maintenance Notes

- Update agent/skill files when adding new capabilities
- Keep AGENTS.md in sync with actual agents
- Update AGENTS_GUIDE.md when adding workflows
- Maintain skills in categories (same directory patterns)
- Keep examples current with latest versions

## For Copilot Suggestions

When suggesting content additions:
1. Check existing files in agents/ and skills/ directories
2. Maintain consistent formatting and structure
3. Include cross-references to related skills/agents
4. Follow YAML frontmatter pattern for skills
5. Use markdown sections consistently
6. Include practical examples with code
7. Reference the appropriate agent for the skill
