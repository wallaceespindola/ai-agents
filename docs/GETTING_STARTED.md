- **Configuration System** - Your personal data stays secure
- **Article Templates** - Ready-to-use starting points

## Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Set Up Your Configuration

```bash

nano .env
```

Fill in at minimum:
```env

AUTHOR_BIO=Your professional bio
AUTHOR_TITLE=Senior Software Engineer
```

(The other URLs are already pre-filled from your profiles!)

### Step 2: Write Your First Article

```bash
# Copy the article template
cp docs/ARTICLE_TEMPLATE.md docs/articles/my-first-article.md

# Edit and write your content
nano docs/articles/my-first-article.md
```

### Step 3: Generate Related Code Project (Optional)

```
Generate Java/Python/JavaScript code for my article about [topic]
Include:
- [specific implementation details]

## The Workflow

### For Writing Articles

1. **Write article** in `docs/articles/ARTICLE.md`
   - Use `docs/ARTICLE_TEMPLATE.md` as starting point
   - Your `.env` values automatically fill in

2. **Optimize for platform**
   - LinkedIn: Use `linkedin-pulse-formatter` skill
   - Medium: Use `medium-optimizer` skill
   - Dev.to: Use `devto-formatter` skill
   - Etc.

3. **Publish** to your platform

4. **Your article automatically includes**:
   - ✅ Your name and bio
   - ✅ Links to your GitHub, LinkedIn, Speaker Deck
   - ✅ Sign-off: "Need more tech insights? Check out my GitHub, LinkedIn, and Speaker Deck. Happy coding!"

### For Code Projects

1. **Write article** explaining the concept

2. **Request code generation**:
   ```
   Generate Java code for my article "Spring Boot REST API Best Practices"
   Include: REST controller, service layer, tests, README
   ```

3. **Get complete project**:
   - `src/main/java/` - Source code
   - `src/test/java/` - Tests
   - `pom.xml` - Dependencies
   - `README.md` - Links to your article

4. **Readers can**:
   - Clone the project
   - Run it locally
   - See working code
   - Reference the article for explanation

## Common Questions

### Q: Where does my personal data go?

**A**: Your `.env` file stays local (never committed to git). All your URLs, emails, and profiles stay private. Only the `.env.example` template is in git.

### Q: Can I publish the same article to multiple platforms?

**A**: Yes! Write once, adapt for multiple platforms:
1. Write master article in `sr-tech-blog`
2. Export as markdown with `markdown-formatter`
3. Adapt for each platform:
   - `linkedin-pulse-formatter` (1000 words)
   - `medium-optimizer` (3000 words)
   - `devto-formatter` (2000 words)
   - Etc.

### Q: How do I customize article sign-offs?

**A**: See `docs/ARTICLE_SIGNOFF.md` for platform-specific variations:
- Standard: GitHub, LinkedIn, Speaker Deck
- With newsletter: Adds Substack link
- All platforms: Links to all your profiles
- Minimal: Short one-liner

### Q: Can I use this for team content?

**A**: Yes! Share `.env.example` (template) with team, each person creates their own `.env` locally. Never commit `.env` files.

### Q: What's the humanization standard?

**A**: All content is written to sound genuinely human, not AI-generated:
- Conversational tone
- 8th-10th grade reading level
- No Oxford commas
- Natural contractions
- Real examples and analogies

See `docs/HUMANIZATION_GUIDE.md` for details.
