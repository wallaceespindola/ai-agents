- Include vendor marketing or hidden promotions
- Write beginner-level tutorials (Medium/Dev.to for that)
- Forget to disclose AI usage if applicable
- Include images without proper rights
- Miss the five key takeaways requirement
- Write vague titles or unclear takeaways

#### Example Five Key Takeaways

```
Key Takeaways:
1. Event-driven architecture reduces coupling between microservices,
   enabling independent scaling and faster feature deployment in
   enterprise environments.

2. Organizations should implement event sourcing patterns when audit
   trails and temporal queries are business requirements, not as a
   default architectural choice.

3. The CAP theorem's trade-offs mean choosing between consistency
   guarantees and availability; Netflix chose availability while
   Airbnb prioritized consistency based on business needs.

4. Distributed tracing and observability are non-negotiable in
   event-driven systems; teams must invest in monitoring before
   complexity becomes unmanageable.

5. Most teams underestimate operational complexity; plan for
   debugging, monitoring, and incident response from day one,
   not as an afterthought.
